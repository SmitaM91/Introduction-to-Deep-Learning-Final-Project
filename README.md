# Introduction-to-Deep-Learning-Final-Project

**Facial Keypoint Detection Through CNN With Data Augmentation**

**Project Overview**
For a part of this project, I will create a convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform facial identification by working through the Facial Kepoints Detection Kaggle Competition. I would like to work on AI navigation systems for spaceships someday, therefore the more computer vision-related things I can learn about, the better. To identify key features in faces, I will employ a supervised deep learning model.

Here is the overflow of the project:-

Download, Import and Inspect the data

1. Clean the data

2. Perform EDA

3. Build an initial CNN, evaluate it against validation

4. Perform hyper parameter optimization to improve results

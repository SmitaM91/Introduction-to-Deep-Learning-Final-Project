# Introduction-to-Deep-Learning-Final-Project

**Facial Keypoint Detection Through CNN With Data Augmentation**

**Project Overview**

For a part of this project, I will create a convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform facial identification by working through the Facial Kepoints Detection Kaggle Competition. I would like to work on AI navigation systems for spaceships someday, therefore the more computer vision-related things I can learn about, the better. To identify key features in faces, I will employ a supervised deep learning model.

Here is the overflow of the project:-

1. Download, Import and Inspect the data
2. Clean the data

3. Perform EDA

4. Build an initial CNN, evaluate it against validation

5. Perform hyper parameter optimization to improve results
